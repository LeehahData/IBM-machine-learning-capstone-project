# IBM-machine-learning-capstone-project

# Introduction
The aim of the project is to analyse loan status of customers and to classify them appropiately using Knn classifier, decisionTree, SVM and Logistic Regression.

# Modelling and Preprocessing
1. Before delivering data to the models, the data was preprocessed.
2. The data preprocessing consisted of cleaning the data and removing unnecessary part.
3. The data was normalized to make modelling easier
4. Classification models like KNN, SVM, DecisionTree, Logistics regression were used to classify whether the customer are likely to be "PAID" or "COLLECTION".
5. DecisionTree of the prediction was built to visually represent the classification.

# Evaluation
Jaccard score, F1 score and logloss were used to evualuate the accuracy of the each models.
